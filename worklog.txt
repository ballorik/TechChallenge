Technical Challenge Work Log

Thursday - Sunday:
    - Multiple attempts to get hubot, along with various adapters and chat programs
        (AIM, Jabbr, Google Hangouts, IRC) up and running met with failure
        - hubot installed via the directions in the git repository, but not responding to any
            requests
            - situation resolved by installing coffee-script (npm install -g coffee-script)
        - Google Hangouts adapter failing to load (python scripts timing out)

        - two free accounts created (one for me and one for hubot)
        - three environmental variables created
            - HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT -> the account name of the user who created the chat room (this name 
                precedes the "campfirenow.com" in the URL)
            - HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN -> value is obtained by logging in to the hubot account and visiting 
                the MyInfo page

            - unresolved
